Network configuration fixer for VMware -> KVM migration.

This package provides comprehensive network configuration fixing for Linux
guest systems being migrated from VMware to KVM. It handles multiple network
backend formats and performs topology-aware fixes.

Main entry point:
    NetworkFixer - Main orchestrator for network fixing operations

Supporting modules:
    - model: Data models and enums (NetworkConfig, FixLevel, etc.)
    - discovery: File discovery and I/O operations
    - topology: Topology graph building and rename planning
    - validation: Post-fix validation to prevent corruption
    - backend: Backend-specific fix implementations
    - core: Main orchestrator coordinating the pipeline
