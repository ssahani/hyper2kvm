# vmdk2kvm 🚀
**VMware → KVM/QEMU Conversion, Repair, and Automation Toolkit** 💻🔧

`vmdk2kvm` is a production-oriented toolkit for migrating VMware virtual machines (VMDK / OVA / OVF / ESXi / vCenter) into **KVM/QEMU-bootable images** **without relying on boot-time luck**. 🎲❌

This project exists to solve the problems that show up *after* a “successful” conversion:
* Broken boots 😵
* Unstable device naming 🔄
* Missing or misordered drivers 🛠️
* Corrupted or misleading snapshot chains 📸
* Windows guests that blue-screen on first KVM boot 💥

This repository is intentionally **not** “click migrate and pray”. 🙏🚫 It is **convert, repair, validate — and make it repeatable**. 🔄✅

## 1. Scope and Non-Goals 🔍
### What This Tool **Does** ✅
* Converts VMware disks into KVM-usable formats 🔄
* Repairs Linux and Windows guests **offline** 🔧
* Applies selected Linux fixes **live over SSH** 🌐
* Stabilizes storage and network identifiers across hypervisors 📍
* Injects Windows VirtIO drivers safely (**storage first, always**) 🛡️
* Flattens VMware snapshot chains deterministically 📸
* Enables repeatable, automatable migrations via mergeable YAML 🔄
* Validates results using libvirt / QEMU smoke tests 🔥

### What This Tool **Does Not** ❌
* No GUI wizard 🧙‍♂️🚫
* No cloud importer ☁️🚫
* No promise of zero-touch Windows fixes 🤖🚫
* No attempt to hide complexity 🕵️‍♂️🚫

If you want *fast over correct*, this repo will argue with you — politely, and with logs. 📜😊

---
## 2. Design Principles 🛡️
1. Boot failures are configuration problems, not copy problems 💥🔧
2. Device naming must survive hypervisor changes 🔄
3. Snapshot chains lie unless flattened or verified 📸🤥
4. Windows storage must be **BOOT_START** before first KVM boot 🪟🚀
5. Every destructive step needs a safe mode 🛡️
6. Configurations must be replayable 🔄
7. Control-plane and data-plane must never be mixed ⚠️

These rules are enforced structurally, not by convention. 🏗️

---

---
## 4. Pipeline Model 🛤️
All execution modes map to a **single internal pipeline**:
```
FETCH → FLATTEN → INSPECT → FIX → CONVERT → VALIDATE
```
Stages are optional. **Order is not.** 🚫

| Stage     | Purpose                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| FETCH    | Obtain disks and metadata 📥    |
| FLATTEN  | Collapse snapshot chains 📸     |
| INSPECT  | Detect OS, layout, firmware 🔍  |
| FIX      | Apply deterministic repairs 🛠️ |
| CONVERT  | Produce qcow2 / raw / etc 🔄    |
| VALIDATE | Boot-test and verify ✅         |

The pipeline is explicit, inspectable, and restart-safe. 🔄🛡️

---
## 5. Control-Plane vs Data-Plane ⚙️
This separation is the **spine** of `vmdk2kvm`. 🦴

- **Control-Plane** decides *what exists* and *what should happen*. 🧠
- **Data-Plane** moves *bytes* and produces *artifacts*. 📦

If you mix them, you get “it worked once” migrations. 🎲 If you separate them, you get repeatable ones. 🔄

### The Rule 📜
* Control-plane **never** moves bulk data. 🚫
* Data-plane **never** makes inventory decisions. 🚫

The “bridge” between them is always **explicit plans + metadata** (never implicit guesses). 🌉

---
### 5.1 Control-Plane Responsibilities (govc-First) 🧠
`govc` is treated as a **first-class control-plane**, not a convenience wrapper. 🛠️✨

Used for:
* VM discovery (name, UUID, MoRef) 🔍
* Disk inventory + backing path resolution (datastore paths, controllers, device keys) 📂
* Snapshot tree inspection + flatten planning 📸
* CBT discovery + changed-range planning 🔄
* Datastore browsing and folder artifact enumeration 📂
* Safety checks (power state, attached ISOs, device layout) 🛡️

`pyvmomi` remains available when:
* API-only fields are required 🔑
* Deeper object-graph traversal is needed 🌳
* govc output shapes aren’t sufficient for a specific edge case ⚠️

Control-plane output is **a plan**: “export this VM, from this source, using these disks, with these safety edits, into these artifacts.” 📝

---
### 5.2 Data-Plane Transports (Byte-Moving Only) 📦
The data-plane answers one question: **How do bytes move safely, reproducibly, and restartably?** ⚡🔄

Supported transports:
#### A) Managed vSphere Exports (Artifact-First) 📦
* **govc `export.ovf` / `export.ova`** — vSphere-managed export flow. 🛠️
  * Best when you want a clean **OVF/OVA artifact boundary**. ✨
  * `export.ova` = single tarball convenience 📦
  * `export.ovf` = directory layout (OVF + VMDKs) that’s friendlier for large disks and partial re-runs 📂
* **ovftool** — VMware/Broadcom’s OVF/OVA workhorse. 🔧
  * Useful when you need ovftool’s compatibility quirks, import/export symmetry, or vendor-specific flags. ⚙️
  * Treated as data-plane because it primarily **produces artifacts** (OVF/OVA + disks). 📦

#### B) Raw Pulls (Fast, Surgical, Resumable) ⚡
* **HTTP `/folder` + Range** — deterministic artifact downloads and CBT-driven incremental pulls. 🌐
* **VDDK** — high-throughput disk reads when you want speed and you can satisfy VDDK runtime + transport constraints. 🚀
* **SSH / SCP** — fallback for constrained environments. 🔑

#### C) Guest-Aware Conversion (Experimental Option) 🧪
* **virt-v2v** — available as an optional integration path, but **not the core philosophy** of this project.
  * Marked experimental because it can be great in the happy path, but it’s not the foundation of the “repair + determinism” model here. 🔄

All of these routes feed the same downstream pipeline stages. 🛤️

---
### 5.3 Export Choices: OVF vs OVA (And Why We Care) 📦
Think of OVF/OVA as **packaging formats**, not “conversion”. 🎁

* **OVA**: Single file; easy to move/store; harder to resume mid-stream; large reruns hurt. 📦🚀
* **OVF**: Directory of artifacts; easier partial retries; friendlier for inspection and selective reuse. 📂🔍

In `vmdk2kvm` terms:
* Choose **OVA** when you want a portable, single-object handoff. 🎁
* Choose **OVF** when you want restartability, transparency, and large-disk practicality. 🔄

Both are still *data-plane outputs* that then feed **INSPECT → FIX → CONVERT → VALIDATE**. 🛤️

### 5.4 Decision Matrix (Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic) 📊
| Goal                                               | Preferred Method                          |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Inventory + Planning                               | govc 🛠️                                  |
| Export as Artifacts (Simple)                       | govc export.ovf / export.ova 🛠️         |
| Export as Artifacts (Compat-Heavy / Special Flags) | ovftool 🔧                               |
| Download Specific Datastore Files                  | HTTP `/folder` 🌐                        |
| Fast Raw Disk Extraction                           | VDDK ⚡                                  |
| No vCenter Access / Restricted                     | SSH / SCP 🔑                             |
| Incremental Sync                                   | CBT Plan (CP) + HTTP Range (DP) 🔄       |
| Guest-Aware Conversion                             | virt-v2v (Experimental Option) 🧪        |

### 5.5 Incremental Migration (CBT) Stays Honest 🔄
CBT usage is explicit and auditable:
```
CONTROL PLANE:
  govc / pyvmomi → changed block ranges 🛠️🔍
        ↓
DATA PLANE:
  HTTP Range GET → local patch application 🌐
        ↓
VERIFY:
  size / range coverage / optional checksums ✅
```
If CBT lies, the tool **flags it**. It does not pretend. 🚩

---
### 5.6 Resume, Integrity, and Checkpoints 🔄
All data-plane operations are built around recovery:
* Resumable transfers 🔄
* `.part → final` promotion (atomic publish) 📦
* Size verification 📏
* Optional hashing 🔒
* Rerun safety (idempotent “skip if complete” semantics) ✅

Same config in. Same result out. No roulette-wheel boots. 🎲❌

---
## 6. Linux Fixes 🐧
* `/etc/fstab` rewrite (`UUID=` / `PARTUUID=` preferred) 📄
* GRUB root stabilization (BIOS + UEFI) 🔄
