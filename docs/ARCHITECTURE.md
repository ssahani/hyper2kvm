# ARCHITECTURE.md — hyper2kvm Internal Architecture

## Purpose

This document dives deep into the **module-level architecture**, execution flow, and unbreakable invariants powering `hyper2kvm`.

It's crafted for contributors, reviewers, and power users who crave insight into:
* **Where the magic (and logic) lives**
* **How data and state flow like a well-oiled machine**
* **Why these boundaries are ironclad defenses against chaos**

The repo is laser-focused on fixing those sneaky "successful" conversions that still flop at boot, network, or stability post-migration.

This isn't random complexity—it's a fortress of containment for reliable, repeatable results.

---

## The Canonical Pipeline

At the heart of everything is this unbreakable flow:

**FETCH → FLATTEN → INSPECT → PLAN → FIX → CONVERT → VALIDATE / TEST**

Not every command hits every stage, but the **order is sacred—never messed with**.

Skip stages if needed, but permutation? Heresy.

### What Each Stage Means (In This Repo's Universe)

* **FETCH**
  Grab source disks *and* metadata from anywhere—vSphere APIs, ESXi via SSH, or local files. Think of it as the hunter-gatherer phase.

* **FLATTEN**
  Tame wild snapshot chains, delta extents, and quirky formats into clean, single-image beasts. No more tangled messes!

* **INSPECT**
  Offline deep-dive using libguestfs to uncover: OS family (Linux? Windows?), firmware (BIOS or UEFI?), mount layouts, bootloader setups, and key files. Ground truth, no guesses.

* **PLAN**
  Strategize *what needs doing* before lifting a finger. Home to inventory scans, dry-runs, and blueprinting. Plan smart, execute once.

* **FIX**
  Drop deterministic patches to ensure bootability and sanity. Offline by default—because who needs runtime drama?

* **CONVERT**
  Handle the heavy lifting: image format swaps and resizing via qemu-img wizardry. Transform VMDK into qcow2 glory.

* **VALIDATE / TEST**
  Ruthless verification with boot smoke tests (libvirt or raw qemu). Does it boot? Network? Survive? Prove it.

This pipeline isn't just a suggestion—it's the law of the land for every migration.

## Control-Plane vs Data-Plane (VMware Paths)

VMware integration is split into two unbreakable realms—because mixing them leads to migration madness.

This divide ensures correctness, auditability, and no "it worked once" surprises.

---

### Control-Plane: Inventory, Intent, Planning

Answers: *What exists? Where? What's the plan?*

Never touches bulk data—keeps it lean and mean.

#### Control-Plane Implementations

**Primary (Go-To Hero): govc**

* Powers:
  * VM hunts (by name, UUID, MoRef)
  * Snapshot tree dissections
  * Disk path resolutions (backings, controllers, device keys)
  * Firmware sniffing (BIOS/UEFI)
  * CBT setup and range queries
  * Datastore/folder explorations
* Why it rocks: Stable CLI, scriptable outputs (JSON/structured), minimal leaks, real-world vSphere coverage.
* Integration: Wrapped in `vmware/vsphere_command.py` for seamless invocation, error handling, and output parsing.

**Secondary / Fallback: pyvmomi / pyVim**

* Kicks in for: govc gaps, deep graph traversals (e.g., full object hierarchies), API-exclusive treasures like advanced property queries or custom vCenter extensions.
* Housed in: `vmware/vmware_client.py`—uses pyvmomi for SOAP API connections, pyVim for task management and session handling.
* Details: Establishes secure connections via `SmartConnect`, queries Managed Objects (MoRefs), and traverses properties with `RetrievePropertiesEx`. Handles authentication, SSL verification, and retry logic for flaky vCenter responses.

**CLI Glue Layer**

* `vmware/vsphere_mode.py` & `vmware/vsphere_command.py`
  Translate user commands (e.g., `vsphere inventory`, `vsphere plan`) into **pure plans**—no data hauling.
  Supports credential injection from env vars or YAML configs.

---

### Data-Plane: Moving Bytes Safely

Answers: *How to shuttle bytes without fibbing or failing?*

No inventory smarts here—just reliable transport.

#### Data-Plane Implementations

* **ovftool** (VMware's Official OVF/OVA Workhorse)
  * Integrated as an external CLI call for OVF/OVA exports/imports.
  * Used when: Compatibility quirks needed (e.g., vendor-specific flags, import symmetry), or for artifact-first exports beyond govc's scope.
  * Details: Invoked via subprocess in `converters/ovf_extractor.py`, with flags for compression, network mapping, and progress tracking. Supports resumable exports and validation of OVF manifests. Treated purely as byte-mover—no planning logic.
  * Why included: Provides symmetry for OVF/OVA handling, especially in hybrid environments or when govc export.ovf/ova isn't sufficient.

* **VDDK**
  * `vmware/vddk_client.py`
  * Blazing-fast disk reads for performance hogs, leveraging VMware's Virtual Disk Development Kit.
  * Details: Uses libvddk for direct disk access over NBD or SAN transports, with multi-threaded I/O for throughput. Handles CBT for incremental pulls.

* **HTTP `/folder`**
  * Datastore downloads with range support for CBT increments. Resumable and stateless—perfect for partial retries.

* **SSH / SCP**
  * `ssh/` modules
  * Fallback for API-blackout zones—simple, secure, universal. Supports key-based auth and file transfers.

* **Local Copy**
  * Routed via `converters/fetch.py`—unifies all paths, with checksum verification.

Post-fetch, VMware vibes vanish. Disks become neutral territory.

---

## Where the Pipeline Actually Runs

### The Orchestrator is the Boss

`orchestrator/orchestrator.py` calls the shots:
* Enforces sacred ordering
* Manages resumes/recoveries
* Triggers sanity checks
* Dispatches converters, fixers, testers
* Compiles epic reports

It dictates **when**—the modules handle **how**. Perfect harmony.

---

### Fix Orchestration: Offline vs Live is a Firewall

* **Offline (Default Fortress)**
  `fixers/offline_fixer.py`
  Leverages libguestfs—no boot reqs, no services, pure disk ops. Mounts images read-write for safe mutations.

* **Live (Opt-In Adventure)**
  `fixers/live_fixer.py`
  Needs a running Linux guest via SSH—keeps runtime assumptions quarantined. Executes scripts remotely with sudo support.

This wall stops leaks: Offline stays pure, live stays contained.

---

## Key Architectural Invariants (Laws of Physics)

These are non-negotiable—break them, and migrations crumble.

### 1) Offline is the Default Truth

Unless explicitly live, fixers assume:
* No systemd vibes
* No efivars or kernel tricks
* Disk images + libguestfs only

Runtime needs? Banished to live mode.

### 2) Inspection Beats Assumptions

libguestfs rules supreme: Derive OS, mounts, firmware, bootloaders—never guess.

### 3) `/dev/disk/by-path` is Radioactive

Any code near fstab, boot cmdlines, initramfs, crypttab **must nuke by-path** and swap in UUID/PARTUUID/labels from real disks. Stability first!

### 4) Windows Logic is Hermetically Sealed

Contained solely in `fixers/windows_fixer.py`. Linux fixers detect and dip— no touching! Cross-pollution? Forbidden.

### 5) Best-Effort, Idempotent-Ish Behavior

* Tolerate re-runs like a champ
* Contain failures, report loud
* Only must-haves halt the train

Repair tool mindset: Iterative, not explosive.

---

## Module Responsibilities (Ownership Map)

### `cli/`
Owns: CLI facade, help docs, YAML showcases. Logic? Not here.

### `config/`
Owns: Merging magic, defaults, guest-injection templates.

### `core/`
Owns: Logs, errors, subprocesses, sanity gates, recovery, validations.

### `vmware/` & `ssh/`
Own: Remotes, inventories, disk grabs. Guest tweaks? Nope.

### `converters/`
Own: QEMU ops, flattening, conversions, container extractions (including ovftool calls).

### `fixers/`
Own: Mutations, offline/live split, reports.

### `modes/`
Own: Read-only modes, inventories, plans.

### `testers/`
Own: Boot tests, harnesses, validations.

---

## Why This Architecture Holds Up

Because failures become predictable and dull:
* No flaky disk IDs
* No busted root=
* No missing drivers
* No stale NICs
* No VMware ghosts
* Surgical Windows fixes

You get:
* **Determinism** (inspection rules)
* **Repeatability** (plans + recovery)
* **Containment** (isolated realms)
* **Composability** (mix-and-match stages)

Migrations turn boring—and boring wins.

---

## Adding a New Feature (Design Rule)

Slot it into **one** bucket:

1. **Fetch Path** → `vmware/`, `ssh/`, or `converters/fetch.py`
2. **Flatten / Convert** → `converters/` (e.g., new extractors like ovftool enhancements)
3. **Inspect / Plan** → `modes/` + helpers (e.g., pyvmomi deep queries)
4. **Fix** → `fixers/` (offline priority)
5. **Validate / Test** → `testers/` + `core/validation_suite.py`

Doesn't fit? Orchestrator coordination only—no bloat.

---

### Final Note

`govc` delivers a **pristine, auditable control-plane**.

`ovftool` powers robust OVF/OVA data-plane exports.

`pyvmomi / pyVim` unlocks deep API insights for fallbacks.

libguestfs supplies **unassailable ground truth**.

The rest? Smart plumbing, strict discipline, and zero guesses.

This is how migrations become routine—and routine is victory.
